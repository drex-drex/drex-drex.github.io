## Drex

Uncaught runtime exceptions have been recognized as one of the commonest root causes of real-world exception bugs in Java applications. However, existing runtime exception detection techniques rely on symbolic execution or random testing, which may suffer the scalability or coverage problem, while rule-based bug detectors (e.g., SpotBugs) provide limited rule support for runtime exceptions. Inspired by the recent successes in applying deep learning to bug detection, we propose a deep learning-based technique, named drex, to identify not only the types of runtime exceptions that a method might signal but also the statement scopes that might signal the detected runtime exceptions. It is realized by graph-based code representation learning with (i) a lightweight analysis to construct a joint graph of CFG, DFG and AST for each method without requiring a build environment so as to comprehensively characterize statement syntax and semantics and (ii) an attention-based graph neural network to learn statement embeddings in order to distinguish different types of potentially signaled runtime exceptions with explainability. Our extensive evaluation on 54,255 methods with caught runtime exceptions and  54,255 methods without caught runtime exceptions from  5,996 GitHub Java projects has indicated that  drex improves baseline approaches by up to  16.9\% in exact accuracy and  17.3\% in F1-score. Our manual analysis on  40 methods has indicated that our lightweight analysis constructs CFG and DFG with high accuracy.  drex detects  20 new uncaught runtime exceptions in  13 real-world projects,  7 of them have been confirmed and fixed, while none of them is detected by rule-based bug detectors (i.e., SpotBugs and PMD).The paper about this work has been submitted to ICSE 2021.
